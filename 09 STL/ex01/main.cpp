// at least one container, explain 
// use c++
// # $(NAME)
// The program name is RPN
// takes an inverted Polish mathematical expression as arg
// The numbers used in this operation and passed as arguments will always be less than 10
// The calculation itself but also the result do not take into account this rule
// handle + - / *
// donâ€™t need to manage the brackets or decimal numbers

// the prog runs correctly using different formulas of your choice
// is not required to handle expressions with parenthesis or decimals number

// 8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 + > Result: 42
// 9 8 * 4 * 4 / 2 + 9 - 8 - 8 - 1 - 6 - > Result: 42
// 1 2 * 2 / 2 + 5 * 6 - 1 3 * - 4 5 * * 8 / > Result: 15

// the merge-insert sort algorithm is used for each container
// A brief explanation 

// manually check that the program works correctly by using between 5 and 10 different positive integers
// gives a sorted sequence of numbers 

// check this operation by using the following command as an argument to the program
// `shuf -i 1-1000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " " `
// explain the difference in time used for each container selected
