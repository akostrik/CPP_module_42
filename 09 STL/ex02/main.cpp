// # $(NAME)
// The name of the program is PmergeMe
//a positive integer sequence as arg
// the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence, Ford-Johnson algorithm
// handle at least 3000 different integers
// to implement your algorithm for each container, thus to avoid using a generic function

// display:
// Before: unsorted positive integer sequence
// After: the   sorted positive integer sequence
// Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00031 us
// Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00014 us
// clearly see the difference between the two containers used
// indicate the time used to perform all your operations 1) the sorting part 2) the data management part
// The management of errors related to duplicates is left to your discretion
